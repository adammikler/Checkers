# Checkers
I'm making this project to showcase the MiniMax algorithm and hopefully make an AI that is strong enough to beat a human player in checkers.
Trying to optomize enough to calculate 10 moves ahead in every position.
First primary goal is to make a 2 player checkers game, then convert one to an AI player.
